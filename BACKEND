The backend is still rather messy

* Gtk_AdobeShaper doesn't use StandardSymbolShaper
* it is not clear whether it works well. For sure the xft version has
  problems (huge characters), the pango version does not find the
  font manager (not installed?)
* can the font managers be generalized?

T1lib support

* add support for loading fonts at different sizes for better quality (cmr5, ...)
* implement TeX-compliant graphic device
* operator minus should use a specific glyph
* implement horizontal braces CM
* implement large horizontal operators CM (fix glyph table)
* fix default line thickness for fractions and square root
* T1LibClose fails if no font is requested??
* some glue glyphs like - have space around them and hence are
  not suitable for the stretchying mechanism as is implemented now
  use "tight" glyphs? use rules?
