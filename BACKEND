The backend is still rather messy

* Gtk_AdobeShaper doesn't use StandardSymbolShaper
* it is not clear whether it works well. For sure the xft version has
  problems (huge characters), the pango version does not find the
  font manager (not installed?)
* can the font managers be generalized?

T1lib support

* add anti-aliasing and mode switching in gtk_renderingcontext
* fix bugs (crashes about invalid glyphs)
* add support for loading fonts at different sizes for better quality (cmr5, ...)
* add support for choosing shapers at runtime
* implement TeX-compliant graphic device
