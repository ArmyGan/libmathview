 <h3>GtkMathView Questions &amp; Answers</h3>

 <h3 class="reverse">General questions</h3>

 <dl>
   <dt>Does GtkMathView require <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a>?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     No. You can compile GtkMathView without <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a>
     and also without X.
     Currently, only the SVG backend can be compiled and used this way.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Does GtkMathView do <em>editing</em> as well as rendering?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     As the name says, GtkMathView only provides a <em>view</em> for a
     MathML document. Its API does not contain any method for changing the
     content of the MathML document being displayed. However, GtkMathView
     does support <em>incremental rendering</em> meaning that if the document
     changes GtkMathView finds out what is the smallest part of it that needs
     to be re-formatted when using the GMetaDOM frontend. When using other
     frontends that have no event notification mechanism, you can still notify
     GtkMathView explicitly about which parts should be re-formatted by
     means of the <tt>gtk_math_view_structure_changed</tt> and
     <tt>gtk_math_view_attribute_changed</tt> methods. In case you're using the
     C++ frontend, similar methods are also provided.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Which features of MathML are <em>not</em> supported by GtkMathView?</dt>
   <dd>
     <ul>
       <li>rendering of <tt>ms</tt> elements does not perform any quoting</li>
       <li><tt>mglyph</tt> elements are not supported</li>
       <li>alignment with <tt>malignmark</tt> and <tt>maligngroup</tt> is not
         supported (it used to be in very old versions of GtkMathView, but was
	 never restored)
       </li>
       <li><tt>fit</tt> table columns do not work</li>
       <li>automatic linebreaking of formulas is not implemented</li>
     </ul>
   </dd>

   <dt>I think I've found a bug, where should I report it?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     You can either post a report on the <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/gtkmathview">mailing list</a>,
     or you can mail the author directly, or you can file a bug report
     on the <a href="http://bugs.mowgli.cs.unibo.it/cgi-bin/bugzilla/index.cgi">bugzilla for GtkMathView</a> (preferred).
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>GtkMathView takes ages to compile, is it normal?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     GtkMathView makes large use of C++ templates and GCC is known to be kind
     of slow to compile them. However, chances are that you don't need to
     compile <em>every</em> feature provided by GtkMathView, here are a few
     suggestions in decreasing order of effectiveness:
     <ul>
       <li>Disable compilation of shared libraries (useful if you don't plan to
         install the libraries and executables) with <tt>--disable-shared</tt>
	 (this basically cuts compilation time by 50%)
       </li>
       <li>Disable the frontends you don't want to use with
        <ul>
         <li><tt>--disable-gmetadom</tt> (don't compile GMetaDOM frontend)</li>
         <li><tt>--disable-libxml2</tt> (don't compile libxml2 tree-based frontend)</li>
         <li><tt>--disable-libxml2-reader</tt> (don't compile libxml2 reader-based frontend)</li>
         <li><tt>--disable-custom-reader</tt> (don't compile custom reader-based frontend)</li>
	</ul>
       </li>
       <li>Disable support for BoxML markup with <tt>--disable-boxml</tt>.
       </li>
       <li>Disable the backends you don't want to use with
        <ul>
         <li><tt>--disable-gtk</tt> (don't compile GTK+ backend)</li>
         <li><tt>--disable-svg</tt> (don't compile SVG backend)</li>
	</ul>
       </li>
       <li>Use <tt>--enable-pipe</tt> at configuration time. In many cases
         this option speeds up GCC.</li>
       <li>Disable support for TFM (TeX Font Metrics) with <tt>--enable-tfm=0</tt>.
       </li>
     </ul>
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>When I render a document I get a funny question mark in a red diamond, what is it?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     This usually happens in two cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>you have used a MathML element that requires <em>n</em> arguments but provided
      only <em>m &lt; n</em>. The missing arguments are rendered as red diamonds.
      </li>
      <li>you have used an empty MathML token (<tt>mi</tt>,...).
    </ul>
    <p>
     If you want to specify a missing MathML element where one is expected, you can use
     an empty <tt>mrow</tt> element.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>When I render a document I get a funny box with little numbers inside, what is it?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     That means that you requested to render a Unicode character which GtkMathView
     is not capable of handling. Usually this happens if no font is found that has a glyph
     for that character.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>What is a <em>shaper</em>?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     A shaper is, within GtkMathView, a component that knows how to use a particular
     family of fonts, through a platform-dependent API, to render a set of
     Unicode characters. There cannot be a single shaper, as rendering math precisely
     is a delicate task that requires a deep knowledge of the fonts in a family, and of
     the very subtle ways the glyphs in these fonts can be combined together. Currently
     GtkMathView provides these shapers:
     <ul>
       <li>DefaultPangoShaper: uses Pango for rendering with no math capabilities</li>
       <li>PangoShaper: uses Pango for rendering those stretchy characters that have
         assigned Unicode indexes for their pieces</li>
       <li>StandardSymbolsShaper: is capable of rendering the glyphs provided by the
         common Standard Symbols font from Adobe (and those having the same map).</li>
       <li>SpaceShaper: provides rendering for space-like characters</li>
       <li>ComputerModernShaper: provides rendering of glyphs in Computer Modern fonts.
         Both Type1 and True Type versions of these fonts are supported.
       </li> 
     </ul>
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Can I control which shaper should handle a given Unicode character?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     Currently you can assign a <em>priority</em> to each shaper so that
     when two shapers are capable of handling the same character, the shaper
     with higher priority &quot;wins&quot;. At the moment
     it is not possible to specify this on a per-character basis, the smallest
     granularity is the shaper. In a future version it might be possible to
     disable the capability of rendering specific characters in specific shapers.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>I'm trying to render a MathML document but all I get is a blank canvas. What's wrong?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     Make sure that the MathML document is a well-formed XML document, that the root element
     is <tt>math</tt> and that all the MathML elements live in the MathML namespace
     <tt>http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML</tt>.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>I'm trying to render the MathML token <tt>&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;</tt> but
     GtkMathView displays a funny box with the numbers <tt>1D44C</tt>. Isn't <tt>x</tt>
     <tt>U+0059</tt>?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     The <tt>x</tt> is indeed <tt>U+0059</tt> however the MathML specification states
     that an <tt>mi</tt> token element whose content is a single character has a default
     <tt>mathvariant=&quot;italic&quot;</tt>, which has the effect of mapping the characters
     in the element to the Unicode Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols block. In particular,
     the <tt>x</tt> is mapped to <tt>U+1D44C</tt>. If no font is capable of rendering
     that particular Unicode character, you get the funny box.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Why does a parenthesis stretch more than is actually needed?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     In many cases a stretched parenthesis is rendered by putting together
     several glyphs, each glyph providing a piece of the whole parenthesis. For instance,
     an open round parenthesis <b>(</b> is usually provided in three pieces, the upper hook
     <tt>U+239B</tt> <b>&#x239b;</b>, the lower hook <tt>U+239D</tt> <b>&#x239d;</b>,
     and an extension <tt>U+239C</tt> <b>&#x239c;</b>. The parenthesis is stretched by
     combining an appropriate number of pieces, where the hooks are always present and the
     extension is repeated as needed. When symbols are stretched this way, their
     size does not vary continuously as the pieces are fixed-size glyphs. So, it may be
     the case that a parenthesis turns out to be <em>over stretched</em> with respect to
     the context where it is required to stretch. You can try using the <tt>minsize</tt>
     and <tt>maxsize</tt> attributes of the <tt>mo</tt> element to control the amount by
     which the symbol is stretched, or you can disable stretchying alltogether by setting
     <tt>stretchy=&quot;false&quot;</tt>.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>What is the Operator Dictionary?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     In MathML, <tt>mo</tt> elements have a large number of attributes affecting
     their rendering. The operator dictionary defines the default values of these
     attributes depending on the element's <em>form</em>, on the observation that in
     most cases the user will not need to change these values. The form of an <tt>mo</tt>
     element is either <tt>prefix</tt>, <tt>infix</tt>, or <tt>postfix</tt> depending
     on its position with respect to its parent element, and on its sibling (the
     exact definition can be found in the MathML specification).
    </p>
     
   </dd>

   <dt>How do I tell GtkMathView to load my own configuration file?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     GtkMathView loads configuration files in this order:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>from the default location <tt>/usr/share/gtkmathview/gtkmathview.conf.xml</tt>
       (the exact location may be different depending on the options passed to the
       configuration script)</li>
     <li>from any path that the user has explicitly specified using the
       <tt>Configuration::addConfigurationPath</tt> method (C++) or the
       <tt>gtk_math_view_add_configuration_path</tt> function (C)</li>
     <li>from the current directory, if a file named <tt>gtkmathview.conf.xml</tt> is found</li>
     <li>from the path specified in the <tt>GTKMATHVIEWCONF</tt> environment variable, if it is set</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Entries in the configuration file can be set multiple times, the last
     value set is the one found.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>How do I specify an application-specific Operator Dictionary?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     You can add the path of the operator dictionary you want to use
     as a <tt>path</tt> key in the <tt>dictionary</tt> section.
    </p>
   </dd>
 </dl>

 <h3 class="reverse">Gtk Backend</h3>

 <dl>
   <dt>Can I control which fonts GtkMathView uses with the Pango shaper?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     You can specify the Pango Text Attributes to be used for mapping
     the various variants in the MathML specification. You can do so
     by specifying a <tt>variants</tt> section within the <tt>pango-default-shaper</tt> section:
     <pre>
      &lt;section name="variants"&gt;
       &lt;section name="normal"&gt;
         &lt;key name="family"&gt;courier&lt;/key&gt;
         &lt;key name="style"&gt;normal&lt;/key&gt;
         &lt;key name="weight"&gt;bold&lt;/key&gt;
       &lt;/section&gt;
     &lt;/section&gt;</pre>
     This specifies that tokens rendered using the <tt>normal</tt> variant should
     look for a font family <tt>courier</tt>, using normal (i.e. up-right roman) style,
     and bold weight.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Can GtkMathView render a formula on a bitmap?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     Yes, look at the <tt>viewer/test_rendering.cc</tt> example in the source tarball.
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>What is a document <em>decoration</em>?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     A decoration is any additional drawing that occurs in the GtkMathView canvas
     and that is controlled by code provided by the user. Whenever GtkMathView 
     renders the document on the canvas, it emits two signals: <tt>decorate_under</tt>
     is emitted just before the document is rendered, and is thus suitable
     for drawing decorations that lay underneath the document, whereas
     <tt>decorate_over</tt> is emitted just after the document is rendered, and is thus
     suitable for drawing decorations that lay on top of the document.
    </p>
   </dd>
 </dl>

 <h3 class="reverse">BoxML</h3>

 <dl>
   <dt>What is BoxML?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     BoxML is a low-level markup language where layout is controlled by
     different kinds of boxes. Horizontal <em>H</em> and vertical <em>V</em>
     boxes have fixed layout. Horizontal/Vertical <em>HV</em> boxes implement
     consistent linebreaking (render the content either as a horizontal box
     as a vertical box depending on the amount of space available).
     Horizontal or Vertical <em>HOV</em> boxes implement
     inconsistent linebreaking (the content is broken only when needed, but not
     necessarily at every break point).
    </p>
    <p>
     BoxML is meant to be an experimental feature of GtkMathView: first of all
     it shows how GtkMathView's architecture supports the mutual
     embedding of different markup languages. Second, the layout algorithms
     developed for BoxML should provide feedback on how to implement
     automatic linebreaking of long formulas in MathML.
    </p>
   </dd>
 </dl>

 <h3 class="reverse">TeX Fonts</h3>

 <dl>
   <dt>What is <em>post-shaping</em>?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     Post shaping enables support for kerning and ligatures for fonts that support
     them. These features take place <em>after</em> a shaper has found the glyphs
     for rendering a particular Unicode character and this is why the mechanism is
     called post-shaping. Post-shaping is controlled by the <tt>post-shaping</tt>
     entry in the configuration file for those shapers that support it.
     <ul>
       <li><tt>always</tt>: always do post-shaping</li>
       <li><tt>never</tt>: never do post-shaping</li>
       <li><tt>math</tt>: do post-shaping when shaping math only</li>
       <li><tt>text</tt>: do post-shaping when shaping text only</li>
     </ul>
    </p>
   </dd>

   <dt>What are <em>TFM</em>s?</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
      TeX Font Metrics are binary files containing detailed information about
      TeX Fonts (in fact, more detailed information than is usually available
      from fonts). Their purpose is to provide a formatting engine with all the
      necessary information for rendering and combining glyphs with the highest
      possible precision, and to define a set of parameters that should be considered
      when using these glyphs. In order to avoid further dependencies on externa libraries,
      GtkMathView can be configured so as to embed TFM data in the generated binaries.
      These data takes some space, of course, so a user may configure the amount
      of TFM data to be embedded by means of the <tt>--enable-tfm</tt> option at
      configuration time. The user can specify 4 values ranging from 0 (no TFM data)
      to 3 (full TFM data). A setting of 1 will include only the minimal TFM
      data for using the main Computer Modern fonts. A setting of 1 will include TFM
      data for all Computer Modern fonts at 10 points. A setting of 3 will include
      TFM data for all Computer Modern fonts at all sizes. TFM data is required
      for post-shaping to work correctly.
