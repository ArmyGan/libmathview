  <h3>MathML to SVG converter</h3>

  This page documents the <tt>mathmlsvg</tt> utility provided with
  <a href="http://mowgli.cs.unibo.it/software/mml-widget/">GtkMathView</a>.

  <h4>Problem</h4>

  <p>
  Complex mathematical objects such as commutative diagrams or finite
  state automata are typically represented as a combination of
  mathematical formulas and more or less complicated graphical
  entities such as arrows, circles, and other kinds of
  decorations. Given that there already exist two standard languages
  for the representation of mathematical formulas (<a
  href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>) and vectorial graphics
  (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a>), it seems
  natural to try to combine the two languages and provide one standard
  way of encoding such complex mathematical objects, so that they can
  be displayed in Web pages.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is possible to embed MathML fragments within a SVG
  document. Typically such fragments are wrapped within a <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/extend.html#ForeignObjectElement"><tt>foreignObject</tt></a>
  SVG element, which is specifically designed to include foreign
  markup in a SVG document. However, with the exception of the <a
  href="http://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla</a>-based Web browsers, no
  tool is currently capable of correctly displaying documents mixing
  both MathML and SVG markup. This situation, which is going to last
  for a long time, prevents compound documents to be authored in an
  effective way.
  </p>

  <h4>Basic idea</h4>

  <p>
  GtkMathView provides an SVG backend which is capable of rendering a MathML
  formula to SVG markup. One advantage of using this backend is that it is
  possible to produce high-quality formulas in a commonly recognized language,
  for which a large number of plugins and processing tools are available, as
  opposed to MathML. In addition, it is possible to use this backend to convert
  MathML islands embedded in an SVG document to SVG, so as to obtain a document
  that is purely SVG, and yet it mixes formulas and graphics.
  </p>

  <p>
  One problem of this solution is that the position of any piece of SVG graphics that is
  meant to decorate a MathML (sub)formula must be guessed or refined by
  trial-and-error. Indeed, as MathML encodes a formula according to its
  structure, there is no way to know the precise location of a (sub)formula, as
  this information is computed by the MathML rendering engine (GtkMathView in
  this case) and discarded as the target document is created. Furthermore, any
  subsequent change to the MathML fragments forces the compound document's
  author to re-compute the exact position of the decorations, as these might
  refer to portions of the MathML that have changed their position. In
  particular, this problem prevents any batch generation of compound MathML+SVG
  documents with nontrivial SVG decorations.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <tt>mathmlsvg</tt> overcomes these problems as it allows SVG elements to
  refer to the position of MathML (sub)formulas by means of their unique
  identifier (in the <tt>id</tt> attribute). Thus, the author is allowed to
  write a piece of SVG document that looks like this:
<pre>
  &lt;line gmv:from="origin($numerator1)" gmv:to="origin($denominator2)"/&gt;
</pre>
  with the intention to draw a line that connects the origins of the MathML
  elements identified by <tt>numerator1</tt> and <tt>denominator2</tt>.
  The idea is that <tt>mathmlsvg</tt>, which internally knows the position of
  any MathML (sub)formula, in addition to converting any MathML fragment into the
  corresponding SVG will also replace the <tt>gmv:from</tt> attribute with a
  pair of SVG attributes <tt>x1</tt> and <tt>y1</tt> where their content is
  exactly the origin of the MathML element identified as <tt>numerator1</tt>.
  The attribute <tt>gmv:to</tt> undergoes a similar expansion, except that it
  produces the attributes <tt>x2</tt> and <tt>y2</tt>. The resulting document
  has no MathML islands, and it is a self-contained SVG document.
  </p>

  <h4>Attribute syntax</h4>

  <p>
  Attributes that are to be expanded by <tt>mathmlsvg</tt> are normal
  XML attributes in the <tt>GtkMathView</tt> namespace, which is
  defined to be
  </p>
<pre>
http://helm.cs.unibo.it/2005/GtkMathView
</pre>

  <p>
  It is usually the case that this namespace is associated with the
  <tt>gmv</tt> prefix, and we will refer to them as to
  <tt>gmv</tt>-attributes. All the examples that follow use this
  convention.
  </p>

  <p>
  A <tt>gmv</tt>-attribute may contain both raw characters that should
  be copied unchanged in the output document, as well as
  <em>expressions</em> that <tt>mathmlsvg</tt> evaluates and replaces
  with their value, once it has been computed. Expressions are
  enclosed within curly braces {...} and are formed according to the
  simple grammar below:
  </p>

<table class="syntax">
  <tr>
    <td><span class="nt">expr</span></td>
    <td>::=</td>
    <td><span class="t">number</span> [<span class="nt">unit</span>]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td/><td>|</td>
    <td>$<span class="t">identifier</span></td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td/><td>|</td>
    <td><span class="t">identifier</span>(<span
    class="nt">expr</span><sub>1</sub>,...,<span
    class="nt">expr</span><sub>n</sub>)</td>
    <td>n &ge; 0 </td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td/><td>|</td>
    <td>(<span class="nt">expr</span>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="nt">unit</span></td>
    <td>::=</td>
    <td class="literal">cm | mm | in | pt | pc | px</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>An expression can be:
<ul>

<li>a numeric constant, optionally followed by a unit
identifier. Numbers with a unit are called <em>scalars</em>.</li>

<li>a reference $<span class="t">id</span> to a MathML element whose
unique identifier is <span class="t">id</span>. Such expression
denotes a <em>location</em>.</li>

<li>a function call <span
class="t">fun</span>(E<sub>1</sub>,...,E<sub>n</sub>) where <span
class="t">fun</span> is the name of the function and the E<sub>i</sub>
are the actual arguments passed to the function. The available
functions are described in the <a href="#functions">section below</a>.</li>

<li>an expression within parentheses.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>A <tt>gmv</tt>-attribute in the source document such as
<tt>gmv:x="s<sub>1</sub>{E<sub>1</sub>}..."</tt> is expanded to a
<tt>x="s<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>..."</tt> attribute in the output
document. The strings s<sub>i</sub> are copied verbatim, whereas the
expressions E<sub>j</sub> are replaced by their corresponding value
V<sub>j</sub>. Notice that the resulting attribute has no namespace
prefix. According to the XML rules, this means that the attribute
inherits the namespace of the element it belongs to, which we assume
to be an SVG element.
</p>

<p>
Some <tt>gmv</tt>-attributes are special as they are expanded to two
SVG attributes. In these cases the expression in the
<tt>gmv</tt>-attribute evaluates to a <em>pair</em> of scalars, and
these two scalars give the value to the two resulting attributes.
This feature is handy as many SVG elements admit pairs of attributes
whose purpose is to represent... a pair! (such as <tt>x1</tt> and
<tt>y1</tt> in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/shapes.html#LineElement"><tt>line</tt></a>
element or <tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt> in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/shapes.html#RectElement"><tt>rect</tt></a>
element). When a pair is expanded within any other
<tt>gmv</tt>-attribute, it is replaced by its two components separated
by a comma. The following table shows the list of
<tt>gmv</tt>-attributes with such behavior. Notice that the name of
the SVG element in which they occur does matter. If they occur
anywhere else in the document, they are expanded as plain
<tt>gmv</tt>-attributes.
</p>

<table class="funtable" border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Element</th>
    <th><tt>gmv</tt>-attribute</th>
    <th>Resulting attributes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td class="literal">gmv:at</td>
    <td class="literal">x y</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="literal">text</td>
    <td class="literal">gmv:at</td>
    <td class="literal">x y</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Expressions in special <tt>gmv</tt>-attributes need not be enclosed
within curly braces.
