BUGS

* when index == length in a glyph area the caret is drawn
  at the right end of the focus' bounding box. It would be
  more appropriate to draw it just after the glyph, especially
  for mo elements
? no indentifiers for the custom frontend? In particular, the widget
  API never handles this (modelElementOfElement and converse method)
? selecting the root <math> element does not show selection
+ fix X font loading mechanism
+ the xft font selection mechanism behaves in strange ways, in
  particular it is no longer possible to select the 'symbol' font
  event if the pattern is close. See the fonts in xfree86 howto by
  Juliusz
- add space in munderover between base and script
- enable percentage in minsize/maxsize stretchable operators

ARCH IMPROVEMENTS

+ Gtk_AdobeShaper: extract shaper for the symbol font and clean up
? make GlyphStringArea a leaf-like area?
- in TemplateBuilder exploit MathMLInferredRowElement instead of
  creating it each time
- make the dummy elements have some content (or an attribute)
  and parameterize their rendering with that content
- change the clone method for areas so that it checks if the
  content is unchanged, and possibly implement the replace this
  way
- implement auxiliary methods for searching into the area model
- it seems like the choice of having that the first child of a
  vertical area is the bottommost is a bit weird. Think of the cursor:
  intuitively at increasing indices the cursor should go forward (that
  is right or down depending on the container)
- It may be feasible to generalize searching functions
  over areas by implementing a visitor
- remove cast in gmetadom_Model::documentFromBuffer when gdome API is OK

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

? make builder maps static members of the TemplateBuilder class
- implement caching mechanism for pango shaper
- in TemplateBuilder do not use the hash map for retrieving old
  elements, but use accessor methods instead. Much faster 
- GetOperatorForm in mrow is linear in the length of the row

MISSING

? make setSelected virtual in Gtk_WrapperArea and implement
  an open Wrapper area that selects all its children. Use the
  open wrapper for groups
- implement table formatting
- implement PS area model (using pslib?)
- implement T1lib area model (using pslib instead?)
- implement MGD for TeX fonts
- implement shaper for TeX fonts (this should be usable with
  both the T1lib and PS area models)
- implement shaper for Mathematica fonts
- implement shaper for Euclid fonts
- runtime selection of backend
- mmultiscripts
- mpadded

// BoxML

BUGS

* rendering a box:text with no text gives weird bounding box

ARCH IMPROVEMENTS

+ The BoxML/MathML embedding mechanism is still ad-hoc and works
  only for MathML inside BoxML
+ remove BoxML paragraph, cleanup box code to a bare minimum

MISSING

- add documentation for boxml
