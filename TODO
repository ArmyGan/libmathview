MathML Implementation

* leftoverlap, rightoverlap in side attribute of mtable
* what if minlabelspacing is a % ?
* axis in rowalign
* table layout is not precise sometimes (e.g. when there is a fit
  table inside a auto column)
* handling of multichars (e.g. followed by modifiers 0xfe00)
? enabling toggle in maction, maction computes the biggest bounding box

Optimizations

* optimize scrolling, it seems to work fine now (see gtkmathview.cc) but
  it has to be tested more heavily
* FontifiedString is no more necessary

Minor improvements

* making script elements breakable
* more comments in the source code
? SetLastBreakability more consistent, what happens if several breakability
  are specified? Take the weakest one?
* hash table for keywords
* memory leaks
* if there is some trailing garbage in an attribute value then
  a warning should be displayed
* using a glyph for the / in bevelled fractions
* making the PostScript document conformant, what about fonts?
* matching the nearest font (w.r.t. size, see LaTeX fonts)
* libxml has iconv! Use it, don't call it directly!

Configuration

* configurable parameters
  (spacings for roots, selecting color, default font attributes)
* setup more horizontal stretchying symbols in font-configuration.xml
* support for STIX fonts in font-configuration.xml

Bugs

* Some chars (mustache) are compound only, they do not have a "simple" form
* problem with color and PostScript generated files
* in font-configuration.xml, the font map for monospace is not complete
* if using libxml 1.x.y inline unicode chars greater that 0x7f doesn't work
* mathvariant and similar attributes don't work in mstyle
* what if there is a horizontal stretchy operator with minsize specified in a mrow?
* getStretchyOperator does not always work properly, please check
