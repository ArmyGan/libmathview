// General

* Priorities for the next minor release:
  * Make high-quality, nice to see rendering in Pango, for both Math and Box
  * Make the widget more robust (font management)

+ make pangolayout pangolinelayout areas configurable (glyph area?)
+ find a way of having TFM support orthogonal to the other classes
+ remove configuration field from gtkmathview class structure
+ pass Configuration to View constructor and initializes default font size
? T1 CM shaper useful for SVG?
? have callback functions to notify progress while building/formatting/etc?
  these should not depend on the backend
- use step area to implement linebreaking in mrows
- add possibility of disabling shaping of certain characters for shapers. Eg:
  <section name="disable-shaping">
    <key name="char">03BB</key>
    <section name="range">
      <key name="from">A0</key>
      <key name="to">B0</key>
    </section>
  </section>

// AbiWord

* move Char.hh.in into auto and cleanup dependencies with the top_builddir?

// MathML

BUGS

- when index == length in a glyph area the caret is drawn
  at the right end of the focus' bounding box. It would be
  more appropriate to draw it just after the glyph, especially
  for mo elements
? selecting the root <math> element does not show selection

ARCH IMPROVEMENTS

? make GlyphStringArea a leaf-like area?
- change the clone method for areas so that it checks if the
  content is unchanged, and possibly implement the replace this
  way
- implement auxiliary methods for searching into the area model
- it seems like the choice of having that the first child of a
  vertical area is the bottommost is a bit weird. Think of the cursor:
  intuitively at increasing indices the cursor should go forward (that
  is right or down depending on the container)
- It may be feasible to generalize searching functions
  over areas by implementing a visitor
- remove cast in gmetadom_Model::documentFromBuffer when gdome API is OK

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

- in TemplateBuilder do not use the hash map for retrieving old
  elements, but use accessor methods instead. Much faster 

MISSING

? make setSelected virtual in Gtk_WrapperArea and implement
  an open Wrapper area that selects all its children. Use the
  open wrapper for groups
- implement PS area model (using pslib?)
- implement T1lib area model (using pslib instead?)
- implement shaper for Mathematica fonts
- implement shaper for Euclid fonts
- runtime selection of backend

// BoxML

BUGS

- understand whether getStep should be used for the height as well
  in a vertical box for determining the distance between elements

MISSING

- add documentation for boxml

// SVG Backend

MISSING

- rendering of BoxML into SVG (hard because we need the shapers!)
- cross-embedding of MathML and SVG following the guidelines?
- cross-embedding of MathML and SVG with coordinates computation?
- document alpha channel in RGBColor
