+ = SHORT TERM
- = LONG TERM

BUGS

* make it possible for the content of a bin/linear container to
  have null elements. For example mfenced may generate these cases.
- applying the variant map before shaping is problematic when
  using the PangoShaper because Pango doesn't know about variant
  chars. This can be seen as a bug of pango or as a bug of our architecture
- add space in munderover between base and script
- enable percentage in minsize/maxsize stretchable operators
- cleanup configure.ac (remove tex stuff, some variables in
  config.h are unset)

ARCH IMPROVEMENTS

+ factor the Element class
+ factor ther View class
+ split formatting engine factories for mathml and boxml and
  make a super-factory keyed by the namespace
+ implement reader interface over DOM, libxml2 tree, XmlReader
- make debugging methods in Areas optional (or remove them)
- fix Configuration/Globals files 
- move mathvariant files into src/common
- operations visiting areas might be factored in a better way

MISSING FEATURES

* implement AreaCanvas for drawing lines (mdummy)
+ implement cursor
+ enable actions in boxml
+ add getId() method to reader interface
- implement table formatting
- implement PS area model
- implement T1lib area model
- implement MGD for TeX fonts
- implement shaper for TeX fonts (this should be usable with
  both the T1lib and PS area models)
- implement shaper for Mathematica fonts
- runtime selection of backend
- runtime selection of reader
- should be possible to exclude boxml classes at configuration time
- add documentation for boxml
- mmultiscripts
- mpadded
- mstyle
- token
