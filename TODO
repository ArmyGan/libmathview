BUGS
* par without width attribute -> assert false
+ step in a boxml paragraph is wrong
+ make it possible for the content of a bin/linear container to
  have null elements. For example mfenced may generate these cases.
+ a box having a step within a paragraph is aligned correctly,
  but the text that follows the box is not. HARD! perhaps we should
  change/remove things like exit entry point?
- paragraph and other boxes are slightly misaligned
- units like cm are wrong (can be the dpi?)
- applying the variant map before shaping is problematic when
  using the PangoShaper because Pango doesn't know about variant
  chars. This can be seen as a bug of pango or as a bug of our architecture
- add space in munderover between base and script
- enable percentage in minsize/maxsize stretchable operators

ARCH IMPROVEMENTS

+ The BoxML/MathML embedding mechanism is still ad-hoc and works
  only for MathML inside BoxML
+ remove the linker from Element. What is the most sensible
  place to put the linker? Perhaps the linker and the reader should
  be merged?
+ View.cc depends on Gtk_WrapperArea, make a WrapperArea which is
  independent of the platform and make Gtk_WrapperArea depend
  on it. Then it may be feasible to generalize searching functions
  over areas by implementing a visitor
+ implement reader interface over DOM, libxml2 tree, XmlReader
+ implement caching mechanism for pango shaper
+ it seems like the choice of having that the first child of a
  vertical area is the bottommost is a bit weird. Think of the cursor:
  intuitively at increasing indices the cursor should go forward (that
  is right or down depending on the container)
- the default font size now need to be set on two different 
  namespacecontexts, ugly. (see gtkmathview.cc)
- make debugging methods in Areas optional (or remove them)
- fix Configuration/Globals files 
- move mathvariant files into src/common
- operations visiting areas might be factored in a better way
- not sure the Origin information should go in the view

MISSING

+ make setSelected virtual in Gtk_WrapperArea and implement
  an open Wrapper area that selects all its children. Use the
  open wrapper for groups
+ minlabelspacing -> spacing in paragraph, use pango layout spacing
+ cleanup code for box paragraph, create an auxiliary class for
  collecting things and handle groups inside paragraphs. What
  about groups inside paragraphs? What about colors inside paragraphs?
+ implement cursor
+ enable actions in boxml
+ add getId() method to reader interface
- implement overstrike and underline for box text ?
- implement available width propagation for boxes?
- implement AreaCanvas for drawing lines
- implement table formatting
- implement PS area model
- implement T1lib area model
- implement MGD for TeX fonts
- implement shaper for TeX fonts (this should be usable with
  both the T1lib and PS area models)
- implement shaper for Mathematica fonts
- runtime selection of backend
- runtime selection of reader
- should be possible to exclude boxml classes at configuration time
- add documentation for boxml
- mmultiscripts
- mpadded
- mstyle ?
- token
