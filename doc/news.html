     Release of version <b>0.6.4</b> (tag <b>v0_6_4</b>). This is mostly
     a bug-fix release, especially for the GTK+ interface. In addition,
     the configuration file has changed name, it is now called
     <tt>gtkmathview.conf.xml</tt>.

     Release of version <b>0.6.3</b> (tag <b>v0_6_3</b>). The main
     improvements are:
     <ul class="compact">
       <li>implemented the custom_ and libxml2_ reader interfaces in the widget API</li>
       <li>implemented read from in-memory buffer for gmetadom and libxml2 frontends (thanks Shuying Wang)</li>
       <li>fixed a few bugs related to the cursor and selections</li>
       <li>removed margin around the formula, which causes problems when
         the widget is embedded
       </li>
       <li>added a test program that shows how to embed gtkmathview inside
         a GtkTextView widget (the test uses the plain libxml2 frontend)
       </li>
       <li>fixed bugs in fixed-point arithmetics that cause wrong
         alignment of formulas with respect to surrounding text</li>
     </ul>
   </dd>

   <dt>May 22, 2004</dt>
   <dd>
     Release of version <b>0.6.2</b> (tag <b>v0_6_2</b>). The main
     improvements are:
     <ul class="compact">
       <li><em>Frontends:</em> Taking
     advantage of the renewed architecture I have implemented 3 more 
     frontends in addition to the one using GMetaDOM. GtkMathView is now
     able to read MathML documents accessible via GMetaDOM, libxml2,
     the libxml2 reader and also a customizable reader for which a
     C API is provided. In other words, GtkMathView is not tied to
     GMetaDOM anymore, plain libxml2 trees can be used, and also GtkMathView
     can read application-specific encodings of MathML documents. We
     plan to exploit this feature to read OCaml data structures directly,
     without passing through a DOM representation.<br/>
     The 4 frontends are completely unrelated and they can be compiled
     in isolation.
       </li>
       <li><em>Library modularization:</em> GtkMathView is now compiled into
         several libraries: <tt>libmathview</tt> (frontend independent
	 rendering engine for MathML and BoxML); <tt>libmathview_frontent_*</tt>
	 (one library for each supported frontend);
	 <tt>libgtkmathview_*</tt> (GTK+ API, one for each supported
	 frontend).
       </li>
       <li><em>Cursor:</em>
         I have introduced an API for handling a cursor, which can
         be displayed as the combination of a focus and/or a caret.
	 The implementation is not completely bug-free, but it is
	 already usable. Those willing to develop
	 direct-manipulation editors of MathML markup should have
	 something to experiment with. The <tt>mathmlviewer</tt>
	 test program has been modified so as to set the cursor
	 to the clicked element.
       </li>
       <li><em>Optional BoxML:</em>
         Support for the BoxML markup has been made optional.
       </li>
       <li><em>Lighter GTK+ implementation:</em>
         GtkMathView now extends the
         GtkWidget class directly (not GtkEventBox as before) and
	 uses no more a GtkDrawingArea for painting, but draws directly
	 in its own window.
       </li>
       <li>Some code and API cleanup.
       </li>
     </ul>

     Release of version <b>0.6.1</b> (tag <b>v0_6_1</b>). This is another
     development release for gtkmathview, which introduces
     a totally redesigned "frontend" for the widget. Starting from this
     version, the frontend is completely decoupled from the formatting
     engine and it is thus much easier to feed gtkmathview with MathML
     documents available by means other than gmetadom. See the
     announcement on the mailing list for more details.
   </dd>

   <dt>Apr 07, 2004</dt>

     Released version <b>0.5.3</b> (tag <b>v0_5_3</b>). This closes
     the bug referred to in <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/cgi-bin/mailman/private/gtkmathview/2003-August/000241.html">this email</a> on the mailing list.
   </dd>

   <dt>Feb 24, 2004</dt>
   <dd>
    Release of version <b>0.6.0</b> (tag <b>v0_6_0</b>). This is a major
    rewrite of most code of the widget which now implements the architecture
    described in my thesis. Although many features which were previously
    implemented are missing in this version (PostScript support and MathML tables),
    I felt too much time had passed
    since the last release and people working at porting and using gtkmathview
    might find more convenient to have a recent snapshot to look at.

     Added a pointer to the <a href="http://numerator.sourceforge.net">
     gNumerator</a> project by Endre Somogyi. Although he is not using
     GtkMathView directly, he's taking GtkMathView's new architecture
     as starting point for implementing a brand new MathML rendering
     engine written in C#. I think his work is particularly relevant as the
     new architecture has not been completely implemented in GtkMathView yet.
     Having one more reference implementation may provide important feedback
     on possible improvements. Week after week gNumerator's home page
     is enriched with screenshots that testify Endre's steady improvements
     and, indirectly, that the architecture actually works! Thanks Endre.

     I have tagged the main trunk with <b>new_arch_test</b>. It is a version
     of the source tree where many things have been updated or are currently
     broken, but it compiles and runs some simple tests. It is important
     to see the new architecture at work, and to compare performances
     with the older versions, especially w.r.t the area model and the
     font selection mechanism.
   </dd>

   <dt>Nov 14, 2003</dt>

    Release of version <b>0.5.2</b> (tag <b>v0_5_2</b>). Only bugfixes for

     I have created a new branch with tag <b>gtk2_patches</b>
     which is used for bug fixes of the GTK2 port with the old
     architecture.
     The code in the main trunk has been largely
     rewritten and is still undergoing major changes.

     Version <b>0.5.0</b> has been released (tag <b>v0_5_0</b>).
     This is the first version
     of GtkMathView ported to GTK2. The porting is not complete as
     GtkMathView still uses some deprecated APIs, however it should be
     as usable as the GTK1.2-based version. Special thanks go to Pouria
     Masoudi who worked on this. In the next few month I expect to maintain
     actively both 0.4.x and 0.5.x versions.

     I've just released version <b>0.4.3</b>. There's been a certain delay
     w.r.t. the uploading of the Debian package, but the sources are finally
     available. Note that this release is in a branch of the CVS repository
     which is going to be dismissed as soon as the GTK2 porting (in
     the main trunk) stabilizes. Among other important news, a
     Bonobo component for embedding GtkMathView is soon to come.

     Version <b>0.4.2</b> has been released. As usual this minor release
     fixes a few bugs of the previous version, but it also switches to
     the <em>pkg-config </em> method for providing compilation and linking
     flags. The reference manual has been extensively updated and is now
     back in sync with the API. Rainer Menzner has released version 5.0.0
     of t1lib, but the bugs that cause
     GtkMathView to crash haven't been fixed.

     At last the <b>edit</b> branch has been merged into the main

     old architecture.
   </dd>

   <dt>February 13, 2003</dt>
   <dd>
     Version <b>0.4.1</b> has been released. This is a major release
     as it is the first version of gtkmathview supporting editing.
     The widget is now able to react to modifications of the source
     MathML tree and re-layout the document incrementally.
     The tag in the CVS repository is v0_4_1. The <b>edit</b> branch will
     be probably merged into the main trunk sometime in the future.
     <br />
     The documentation has not been updated, although very few things
     changed in the API (just the signals, selections and management
     of <tt>maction</tt> elements).
     <br />
     miniDOM is not supported anymore (but the <tt>configure.ac</tt>
     still tries to detect it).

     Version <b>0.3.1</b> has been released. This is the first release
     after many months. Actually, 0.3.1 fixes a few minor bugs. The
     main development efforts have been spent on the <b>edit</b>
     branch of the repository, where support for editing is being
     implemented. The tag in the repository is v0_3_1.

    <b>miniDOM 0.1.4</b> released. This is just a minor version which
    fixes some problems in the configuration script. Use of miniDOM is

    Version <b>0.3.0</b> has been released. The main news is that the
    widget is now based on <a
    href="http://gmetadom.sourceforge.net">GMetaDOM</a>, even though
    backward compatibility with <b>miniDOM</b> has been retained. If
    both libraries are installed, then <b>GMetaDOM</b> is used. The

    InterScience</a> <a
    href="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/epst/index.html">Encyclopedia
    of Polymer Science and Technology</a> has been released. All the

    The new release 0.2.1 of the OCaml binding for miniDOM released.
    The code is exactly the same, but the autoconf/Makefile stuff has
    been improved.  Moreover, the version number has been changed to
    keep it in sync with the debian package. The upgrade is necessary
    only for packagers, while normal users can just keep the 0.0.2
    version. Sorry for the trouble.

    The new OCaml bindings for miniDOM and GtkMathView have been
    released.  There are still problems with the memory management of
    the miniDOM binding: it is up to the user to avoid to invoke
    methods on the nodes of the tree after the whole tree has been
    garbage collected. The problem should disappear once GDome2 is

    0.2.8 has been released. This version contains a few bug fixes for
    the GTK interface, a better handling for the <tt>maction</tt>
    element. But the most important improvement is a much higher
    quality rendering to PostScript, now almost comparable to that of
    TeX. Unfortunately, the current architecture is showing its
    limits, and for further refinements it will have to be
    considerably redesigned. Note that you need the latest version of
    minidom (0.1.3).

    Ok guys, here is another version without support for Gdome2. Sorry
    for that, but I had to fix a number of bugs related to the
    &lt;maction&gt; element. This version is on the secondary branch
    in the CVS repository, the tag is v0_2_7.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>July 3, 2001</dt>
  <dd>
    Released version 0.2.6, which uses t1lib subsetting in order to
    get smaller exported Postscript files.  This extra-release has
    been packaged in a hurry, so it may contain bugs. Note also that
    there is a branch in the CVS repository starting at v0_2_5, since
    the main trunk has already adopted Gdome, while 0.2.6 still uses
    minidom.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>May 19, 2001</dt>
  <dd>
    Released version 0.2.5. This is, in my intentions, the last
