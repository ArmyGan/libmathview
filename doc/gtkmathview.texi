@chapter  Overview
@noindent
GtkMathView is a C++ rendering engine for MathML (see @url{http://www.w3.org/Math})
documents. This module is meant to be part of the
Helm project (see @url{http://www.cs.unibo.it/helm/}), but
the widget is independent from it and easily
embeddable within GTK applications. This library is
covered by the GNU General Public Licence (@emph{not}
the GNU LGPL, this means that the library cannot be linked against commercial
applications. See the file COPYING included in the distribution for more details).

@section  Requirements
@noindent
To compile and use the widget you need the following packages
installed on your system:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{GTK} (version 1.2) @url{http://www.gtk.org}, of course.
@item
@code{libxml} @url{http://xmlsoft.org}, be careful
because all current Linux distributions come with version 1.x of libxml
@emph{which is not compatible} with version 2. If you need both you will have to
customize the installation of libxml2 so that it does not produce
conflicts with previous versions. From version 0.1.1 of the widget it has
been added backward "compatibility" with version 1.8.x of libxml, however
this compatibility is not fully effective due to some bugs of libxml. It is
recommended to upgrade to version 2. See file INSTALL for more details.
@item
@code{minidom} (version 0.1.1) @url{http://cs.unibo.it/~lpadovan/mml-widget},
this is a minimal, partial implementation of the DOM used by the widget as
an abstract interface to @code{libxml}. It will be eventually replaced by
GDOME when there will be a package for it.
@item
@code{gcc/g++} (version 2.95.3, this is the version I currently use, but the widget
will probably compile and run without problems even with some previous versions).
@end itemize

@itemize @bullet
@item
@comment FIXME: update the link for t1lib
@code{t1lib} (version 1.0.1) @url{ftp://ftp.neuroinformatik.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/pub/software/t1lib/}
Actually, this library is not required, however, if you have it, you will
be able to use Type1 fonts independently from the X font server. Furthermore,
you will be able to render anti-aliased text and exploit kerning information,
if available. This library is also needed in the case you want to export MathML
to PostScript.
Finally, the configuration script is usually able to autodetect the library,
if installed, however you will have to configure some files and environment
variables. See the section about font installation below.
@end itemize

@section  Installing
@noindent
Keep in mind that the widget will not compile if @code{minidom} is
not installed.
See the INSTALL file included in the source distribution for
detailed compilation and installation instructions. After installation
you will have the following files:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{/usr/local/bin/gtkmathview-config} this is the configuration
script. Use @code{gtkmathview-config --cflags} to get compilation flags
of source files using the widget. Use @code{gtkmathview --libs} to get
linking flags and libraries to be linked with your object files.
@item
@code{/usr/local/include/gtkmathview/} include files (you have to include
@code{gtkmathview.h}).
@item
@code{/usr/local/lib/} libraries. Unless you
gave @code{configure} one of @code{--disable-static} or
@code{--disable-shared} you will find in this directory both static and shared
versions of the widget.
@item
@code{/usr/local/info/}, the info file. You can browse it
with the command @code{info -f /usr/local/info/gtkmathview.info}.
@item
@code{/usr/local/share/gtkmathview/} some configuration files (fonts,
operator dictionary and general configuration) along with their DTDs.
@end itemize


@node     Compile and Link, Font setup, Installing, Usage

@section  Compile and Link

@noindent
To compile a source file which uses the widget use the command

@example
gcc -c filename.c -l... -I... `gtkmathview-config --cflags`
@end example

@noindent
The widget is compiled by default to generate both static and shared object file.
It can be linked dynamically against your applications with
the command:

@example
gcc -o appname *.o `minidom-config --libs` `gtk-config --libs` `gtkmathview-config --libs`
@end example


@node     Font setup,     , Compile and Link, Usage
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section  Font setup
@noindent
The widget is designed to use the best fonts available on the
system. As of today the font configuration file (@code{font-configuration.xml}) is
designed to use the fonts that comes with the X distribution, in
particular `times' for plain text and `symbol' for mathematical
symbols. In addition to this, the configuration file includes the
description of fonts coming along with @emph{Mathematica} and some of the
LaTeX fonts.

On September 8th it has been released the first version of free fonts from
the STIX project. You can download them freely at

@example
ftp://ftp.elsevier.nl/pub/styles/esstix/esstix.zip
@end example

@noindent
However, the file @code{font-configuration.xml} must be properly setup to recognize these
fonts. As of today I have no time to seek for each single glyph name, so
if someone has enough patience and wants to contribute here is a very long
work for him/her.

@noindent
@strong{A special note about True Type fonts}: recent X servers can render
a wide variety of fonts, including True Type fonts usually shipped with
Microsoft Windows and friends. These fonts often have more flexible scaling
capabilities and you could find the final rendering really improved by their use.
Since their handling is almost completely hidden inside the X font server,
the widget needs not any special configuration to use them, apart from a proper
setting of the font configuration file (@code{font-configuration.xml}). In particular,
True Type versions of Mathematica fonts are available as well, but be careful,
because some of the fonts provided still have problems with the X server,
and in some cases the mapping of character is different from a Type1 font
to the related True Type version.

@noindent
@strong{Type1 fonts and the t1lib library}: starting from version 0.2.0,
the rendering engine can use the @code{t1lib} library to render Type1 fonts.
The support for this library is still under development (well, as anything else),
here are some tips to configure the engine so that you can use Type1 fonts
(please, consult the @code{t1lib} documentation at library's home page for firther details).

@noindent
First of all, you have to setup a little configuration file for the t1lib library.
Call this file @code{t1.config} and place it somewhere in your home directory.
Here is a sample file:

@example
#
#
ENCODING=.
AFM=/usr/share/texmf/fonts/afm/
TYPE1=/usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/bluesky/cm/:/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/:.
@end example

@noindent
In particular, you have to specify where your Type1 fonts resides (@code{TYPE1}) along
with their metrics (@code{AFM}). Metric information in optional, since it can be (mostly)
recovered by the font file itself. However, it is needed if you want to exploit for
instance kerning. A sample configuration file for @code{t1lib} is included in the
standard distribution of @code{gtkmathview} and is installed in
@code{/usr/local/share/gtkmathview/}.

@noindent
Next, you have to setup an environment variable @code{T1LIB_CONFIG} with the full path to this
configuration file. For example, if you use @code{bash}:

@example
export T1LIB_CONFIG=./config/t1.config
@end example

@noindent
And, if you use @code{tcsh}:

@example
setenv T1LIB_CONFIG ./config/t1.config
@end example

@noindent
Now you are ready to use Type1 fonts.

@chapter  Interface to the  Widget

@noindent
Macro: @code{GTK_TYPE_MATH_VIEW}
@quotation
used to get the GTK type for the @code{GtkMathView} class. You don't
usually need tu use this macro, unless you are subclassing @code{gtkmathview}.
@end quotation

@noindent
Macro: @code{GTK_MATH_VIEW(object)}
@quotation
used to cast a GtK widget to a @code{GtkMathView} class. Remember that
all methods working with the widget takes a pointer to @code{GtkMathView}.
@end quotation

@noindent
Macro: @code{GTK_MATH_VIEW_CLASS(klass)}
@quotation
used to cast a Gtk class to a @code{GtkMathView} class. This macro is used internally,
so you probably don't need it.

@quotation
allocates a new Gtk type for the class @code{GtkMathView}. Used internally.
@end quotation

@noindent
Method: @code{GtkWidget* gtk_math_view_new(GtkAdjustment* h_adj, GtkAdjustment* v_adj)}
@quotation
this is the main constructor for @code{GtkMathView}. It allocates a new @code{GtkMathView}
object. You can pass a couple of adjustments fro the scrolling bars, or just @code{NULL} in the

if you are interested in only one of the two values.
@end quotation

@noindent
Method: @code{void gtk_math_view_set_top(GtkMathView* widget, guint top_x, guint top_y)}
@quotation
set the coordinates (in pixels) of the upper left displayed corner of the
document.

Set the font manager used by the widget to retrieve fonts. Up 'till now, there are
two valid values for @code{id}: use @code{FONT_MANAGER_GTK} to use the GTK font
manager (actually, this is just a wrapper for the X font manager). This is the default.
Alternatively, use @code{FONT_MANAGER_T1} to use @code{t1lib} and Type1 fonts. This
font manager is availabe only if you have installed the @code{t1lib} library.

@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@chapter  Configuration

@noindent
Starting from version 0.2.2 the widget has a rather flexible configuration system.
If you made a default installation, you'll find all the configuration files in
@code{/usr/local/share/gtkmathview}. In particular, the file
@code{math-engine-configuration.xml} contains all the references to the other
configuration files (operator dictionary, fonts, entities, @code{t1lib}).

@noindent
You can set the environment variable @code{MATHENGINECONF} to the full path
of the configuration file. If the variable is not set, the widget will try to
load the configuration file from the default location.

@noindent
The list of valid entries is presented below:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{dictionary-path} This element contains a full path to an operator
dictionary (the default is @code{dictionary.xml}). You can use this
element several times if you have more than one dictionary. This can be
useful to have a general dictionary and another local dictionary with
your preferences. An operator found in a subsequent dictionary overrides
previous settings for the same operator.

@item
@code{entities-table-path} This element contains a full path to
an XML file with some entities definitions. The widget has an internal
table with all the entities defined in the MathML 2.0 specification so,
unless you disabled it inside the source code, the entities won't be
loaded from this file.

@item
@code{font-configuration-path} This element contains a full path to
a font configuration file. The format of such file is still undocumented,
but you can take a look at the DTD and the source file @code{CharMapper.cc}
for more details.
You can use this element several times if you want to override or enrich
the settings of the default configuration (see @code{font-configuration.xml}).

@item
@code{t1-config-file} This element contains a full path to the
configuration file for the @code{t1lib} library. In particular,
it is not necessary to explicitly set the @code{T1LIB_CONFIG} environment
variable if this element is set.

@item
@code{font-size} This element has an attribute @code{size} which
specify the default font size for the rendering. The size format is 
the same as for the analogous attributes for MathML token elements.

@item
@code{color} This element has two attributes, @code{forground} and
@code{background}, which specify the default colors of the rendering.
The format of these two attributes is the same as for the analogous
attributes for MathML elements.

@item
@code{link-color} Default color settings for MathML elements with
a @code{href} attribute. Same attributes as for @code{color}.

@item
@code{select-color} Default color settings for selected elements.
Same attributes as for @code{color}.
@end itemize

@chapter  Bugs and Contributions
@noindent
Of course, I appreciate any kind of contribution. The most basic (and, maybe, frequent)
one is bug report, sending me an email (@email{luca.padovani@@cs.unibo.it})
with a short description of the problem encountered, a list of the error messages
or failed assertions and the simplest MathML document that causes the trouble.

@noindent
Furthermore, the widget is still not complete, it lacks the proper handling
of some MathML elements and attributes, and I think that there are several
improvements which can be done. A note about this: the widget is based
on the MathML 2 Working Draft, which is not
yet confirmed as standard at the moment of writing, however it is assumed to be a
rather stable version.
